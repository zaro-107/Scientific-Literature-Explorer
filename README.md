##Scientific Literature Explorer
Deep Search & Question Answering Platform using Generative AI
Overview

Scientific Literature Explorer is a community-driven platform that enables users from different backgrounds to upload scientific literature and perform deep semantic search and question answering across a continuously growing knowledge base.

Unlike traditional keyword-based academic search systems, this project leverages Generative AI, vector embeddings, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware, and explainable answers sourced from multiple research documents.

##Problem Statement

Scientific knowledge is scattered across vast numbers of research papers, making it difficult to extract precise, meaningful information using traditional keyword-based search engines. Researchers and learners often spend significant time reading entire papers to find specific answers.

This project aims to solve this problem by building a deep search QnA system that understands natural language queries and retrieves answers from multiple scientific documents using semantic understanding.
